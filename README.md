# Pedal Toolbox

## About

_This plugin is built with
[Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/) &
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)_

This plugin utilizes the
[JS Intl formatting API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)
in the localizer utilities to format date, time and number strings given a set
of locale and style options.

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v18
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

To build the plugin:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/)
file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the
plugin. To edit the `manifest.json` file, update the corresponding fields in
`package.json`.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the plugin

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run `Import plugin from manifest…` via the Quick Actions
   search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.

### Debugging
